# Methodology

- Data preprocessing: handled missing values, converted categorical variables to numerical variables
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): visualized distributions, correlations, and relationships between variables
- Customer segmentation: applied k-means clustering to identify distinct customer segments
- Predictive modeling: trained a random forest classifier model to predict subscription status

# Key Findings
